          </h3>
          <p>Posted on 5/02/2016</p>
          <hr>
          <p>So recently Delight Works, the Japanese company developing Fate:Grand Order has decided to fix its "re-rolling" problem by banning China's IP. To be honest, that's just a temporary fix that doesn't really do anything except anger any real players unlucky enough to use servers located in China. And "re-rollers" can just circumvent the ban by using VPN's
          And when you lock out the enitre population of the highest populated country as of right now, that is a major loss.</p>

          <p>To understand this problem I'll be explaining a few things first before talking about ways to fix it. First up...</p>
          <p style="font-size: 18px">What is rerolling?</p>
          <img src="images/coin-op.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" align="left">
          <p>For those of you that are new to mobile games, there is a type of free-to-play mobile games commonly refered to as "Gacha" games, which are named after the Japanese Gachapon. The idea is similar to that of a vending machine, but instead of getting something you want, you get something random instead which could or could not be the thing you were looking for. As for the term "rolling," most people liken it towards a rolling slot machine.</p>
          <p>In most games of this nature, the player is usually given a free roll or a set of free rolls after a tutorial. After that, the game functions similarly to that of a trading card game where you pay money, whether earned in-game or through microtransactions, in order to get various rarities of goodies. Usually premium currency can be earned fairly quickly for even more rolls. If a players' roll wasn't particularly a good one or just something they did not want, most players will start the game over and "re-roll" until they get a good roll...usually by un-installing the app, deleting any local files, re-downloading the mobile game, and doing the tutorial all over again. This process, repeated ad-nauseum, can eventually end up with what essentially is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack"> DDOS attack</a>. </p>
          <p>"Re-rolling" becomes an issue when either a really popular game has a special event, doubly so if it is a limited-time special event. Because most mobile games have a feature where you can transfer your data to another device, this opens up the opportunity for people to make some money. Much like in a trading card game, certain prizes have a higher individual price with the main determining factors being power and rarity. The higher both factors are, the higher the price for prize is. With a bit of time and luck, a person's account can be worth anywhere between $5 or $100. Which, considering that the game costs nothing to start playing and that you can end up with something that can cost upwards to $100, leads to some people re-rolling and selling accounts for really good money.</p>
